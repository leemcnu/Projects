A repository containing all of my projects, including independent and group projects from class work at Michigan State University

Hello, My name is Liam McNulty and I am a Computational Data Science student at Michigan State University planning to graduate in Spring 2026.

This is a collection of my data analysis work done throughout my time at Michigan state, including independent and group work in multiple classes involving data analytics.
I hope to work in fields involving sports data and sports science, which is why some of my work focuses on using sports data. 

Thank you for taking the time to look at my work
