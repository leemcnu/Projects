This is a project completed in Spring of 2023 which involves utilizing draft combine data in an attempt to predict which metrics lead to quarterbacks having the most success. Wihle the original purpose was a struggle, I later changed the purpose to figuring out
which combine metrics lead to a QB being a higher draft pick. 
While this was relatively early in my experience as a data analyst, I think it shows my passion for sports and parts of why I want to end up in a data analysis role within sports. 
If I were to revisit this project and expand on it, I would look at other positions, and also try to utilize college statistics and advanced metrics to try to improve my analysis. 
I would also carry on this work to a future draft class and try to predict the order in which players will be picked.
